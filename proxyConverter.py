# Quick and dirty lil py script to convert the https://webshare.io proxy file to something https://github.com/HerrEurobeat/steam-comment-service-bot understands
# File must be in the same directory as this script and named "input.txt"
# Script will create and write to a file called "proxies.txt" so that you can instantly copy it to the folder of your steam-comment-service-bot installation.

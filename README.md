# webshare-proxies-file-converter
Quick and dirty lil py script to convert the https://webshare.io proxy file to something https://github.com/HerrEurobeat/steam-comment-service-bot understands  

File must be in the same directory as this script and named "input.txt"  
The script will create and write to a file called "proxies.txt" so that you can instantly copy it to the folder of your steam-comment-service-bot installation.  

To run, open a terminal in this folder and run the script with python: `python proxyConverter.py`
